    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <section class="about">
        <p>I’m a Sydney-based developer with a passion for building things that make life easier, cleaner, and more connected. What draws me to coding is the constant opportunity to learn. I am always learning new skills by pursuing personal projects, as highlighted in my blog, where I explore new technologies and take on challenges that push me to grow.
I’m passionate about creating clean, functional designs while always looking for ways to improve, refactor, and grow.
Outside of coding, you can find me learning about languages and how we connect with one another. I’m also a strong advocate for mental health awareness and believe that empathy and understanding are just as important in tech as technical skills.

Don't blink or you'll miss the magic.</p>
