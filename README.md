[My portfolio site](link_to_your_site)

## Content
While designing this portfolio I thought of how I wanted to show myself off and all of my creations.
I decided a pastl bright theme to match my soul and yet a clean and simple design to keep in theme with my way of thinking especially when it comes to problem solving.

- [ ] Functional Contact Form

## Technical
